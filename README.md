## Project Description

Here I have created an employee reimbursement system that in its basic state can handle the necessary requirements 

## Technologies Used

* AWS RDS
* Java
* Javalin
* JDBC
* Postman
* PostgreSQL


## Features

* Employees and managers can submit requests for reimbursement with the following requirements: the type of reimbursement, the amount requested for reimbursement, and a description of the reason for request.
* Managers can view all reimbursement requests that have been submitted and they are able to approve/deny the request, changing the overall status of the request
* All users have the ability to submit reimbursement requests themselves quickly and efficiently, 

To-do list:
